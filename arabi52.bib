Starts by stating that, essentially, the fudnamental quantum lawas are well defined; however, the resultant mathematics are too difficult to be evaluated exactly. Research now lies in developing approximations that can adequately describe quantum systems. This lecture covers the basic history of development of quantum chemistry models--starting with Hartree Fock, MP, CCD, and CI.},

Rather, Davidson believes that the strength of theory is in understanding reasons guiding physical phenomena. For this reason, he discusses getting 'the right reason for the right reason.' For example, he bleieves using semi-empirical methods provides teh righ solution for the wrong reason, while some ab initio methods may be inaccurate and give the wrong answer for the right answer. He believes it is best to strive for both accuracy and theoretical understanding.},

It discusses a paper published by Zhang, et. al., in which the group mistakenly calculated an excited state for ferrocene using 6-31+G** basis set. Zhang and co. followed traditional safety-check protocols to ensure their solutions were correct, yet they still found an unrelaxed solution. Pulay warns this kind of issue occurs when true understanding of underlying theory of software is not understood. Martin, et. al. finds correct solution using diffuse basis sets.},

To improve the bottle-neck caused by this double integral, a direct SCF approach was designed. This apprach improved integral evaluation time, SCF convergence accelearation, and implemented symmetry blocking.},
