  annote = {Typically an orbital model such as Hartree Fock self-consistent-field theory neglects
  instantaneous interactions (correlations) between electrons, which is crucial for the description 
  of chemical bond formation. The term “electron correlation energy” is usually defined as the
  difference between the exact nonrelativistic energy of the system and the Hartree-Fock (HF) energy. 
  This paper is a review of electron correlation techniques, focusing on single configuration-based 
  techniques which start from a Hartree-Fock wave function, and briefly reviewing Multiconfiguration
  -based correlation techniques. Perturbation theory, configuration interaction, quadratic Configuration 
  Interaction, Coupled Cluster Theory, Gaussian-2 Theory, and Quantum Monte Carlo are among the subjects
  discussed.},

  nonlinear optimizations of both the wavefunction and the molecular geometry may converge

  not a saddle point vs. a true minimum has been obtained is frequently omitted as long as 
  chemical intuition or analogy indicates thatthe correct solution has been obtained. Parameters are
  often poorly defined because they are operationally determined - that is, the actual program
