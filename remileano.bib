  -based correlation techniques. Perturbation theory, configuration interaction, quadratic Configuration

  treatment of electron correlation, zero-point vibrational energies, non-Born-Oppenheimer effects, relativistic
  effects, and core-electron correlation. Allen and coworkers developed the focal point analysis (FPA) approach
