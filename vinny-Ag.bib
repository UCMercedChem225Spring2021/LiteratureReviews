  annote = {This article highlights concern and pitfalls of the usage of quantum chemistry software as "black box" tools. Structural saddle points and "operationally determined" 
  values are two examples commonly misleading researchers. They further address these concerns with focus on ferrocene geometry optimization that yielded different 
  iron-carbon bond lengths depending on the basis sets used. Methods that would traditionally rule out erroneous results failed because they instead verified known accuracies such as
  the molecular geomtetry and adherence to the Aufbau principle. Upon further investigation they discovered the problem lie with the diffuse P functions used with the 6-31G basis sets.
  This diffuse p function effectively duplicated an sp-like orbital and caused inaccuracies with the initial orbital functions. They make the recommendation of the m6-31G basis set when modeling transition metals, due to its sufficient diffuse 
  d-orbital. Overall the authors demonstrate the need for skilled theoretical chemists capable of dicerning problems with the fundamental calculations we use to power our models},
