  problems, and the methods we use to treat these various correlations. Before giving a theory by theory discussion the author lays out the general requirements for a 
  good theoretical model in terms of its ability to treat correlation. These are size consistency, variational, correctness for a two-electron system, and computational 
  dependance.},

  annote = {This article highlights concern and pitfalls of the usage of quantum chemistry software as "black box" tools. Structural saddle points and "operationally determined" 
  values are two examples commonly misleading researchers. They further address these concerns with focus on ferrocene geometry optimization that yielded different 
  iron-carbon bond lengths depending on the basis sets used. Methods that would traditionally rule out erroneous results failed because they instead verified known accuracies such as
  the molecular geomtetry and adherence to the Aufbau principle. Upon further investigation they discovered the problem lie with the diffuse P functions used with the 6-31G basis sets.
  This diffuse p function effectively duplicated an sp-like orbital and caused inaccuracies with the initial orbital functions. They make the recommendation of the m6-31G basis set when modeling transition metals, due to its sufficient diffuse 
  d-orbital. Overall the authors demonstrate the need for skilled theoretical chemists capable of dicerning problems with the fundamental calculations we use to power our models},

  valuable tools in which computational models are utlized to predict thermochemical data from quantum simulations. Of these data Enthalpy's of reaction are most sought
  after b/c if accuarate they can be used to obtain other thermo values. An interesting sidenote; the author defines the enthalpy of reaction as the formation of the target
  molecule from completely dissociated atoms. Generally, formation enthalpies are calculated from atoms in some native state. The paper goes in to detail},
