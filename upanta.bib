  annote = {1999 Nobel lecture from John A. Pople. Dirac's remark- "The fundamental laws necessary for the mathematical treatment of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus completely known, and the difficulty lies only in the fact that application of these laws leads to equations that are too complex to be solved." Talks about five stages of development of theoretical models- Target, Formulation, Implementation, Verification, Prediction. Proceeds to describe HF theory framework. Goes on to talk about correlation models and general energy models. Using higher order energy expansion, accuracy in energy can be increased. Having big basis set also increases the accuracy. Both make the calculation compuationally expensive.}
