  annote = {Nobel lecture given by John Pople on his work in computational methods for quantum chemistry. The article present a brief theory on computational chemistry, and how the advances in computing power led to the more broadscale implementation of the Schrodinger-Dirac treatment of atoms into molecular systems beyond the lone hydrogen atom, beginning with Hartree-Fock (HF) theory. The mathematical foundation of HF theory is expressed in deatail, including its core issue, the lack of electron correlation. Methods that attempt to treat the problem of electron correlation, such as configuration interaction and Møller−Plesset theory, are presented as possible solutions, but conflicting desires for high-level chemical accurracy and size-consistent computational scaling are shown to be the main limations for most models. In general, Pople also provides a well written breakdown of what it means to construct a theroertical model in regards to quantum chemistry, and lists the key stages a theorist must try and reach in the goal of developing a robust and accurrate model.},

  annote = {The article presents a detailed history of the life and work of Ernest Davidson, a pioneer in the field of computation chemistry and appiled theory. Davidson details his educational backstory and highlights some of his most notable work. Accross the text, his central goal is to discuss one of the main problems in the current field, namely the over focus on computational results, while lamenting the lack of desire for many chemists to actually try and understand and develop the underlying theoretical models that form the basis for quantum chemistry calculations. He discusses the rise of so called semi-empirical models, namely DFT, and how the black box nature of such methods meant calculations could be done by those with only a minimum knowledge of theory. Davidson stresses that while accessability is important, presenting computational results as fact without an understanding of the reasons they obtained such a result leads to potentially dangerous consequences when these semi-empirical methods are used carelessly. },

  annote = {The history and attempted solutions to the problem of electron correlation is discussed in depth. Starting from a Hartree-Fock level of theory, approaches such as configuration interaction methods, coupled cluster theory, and perturbative based methods such as the Møller−Plesset theory are all analyzed from their treatment of electron correlation. More recent developments in the field of quantum Monte Carlo methods are also presented. For smaller molecules and basis sets, most of the single-configuration based theories provide accurate and fast results. However, the exponential scaling in regards to computational time means that many techniques become impossible to use for decent sized moluecular structures. Multiconfiguration theories, Monte Carlo methods, and density functional theory all represent alternatives that sacrifice a less explicit imlentations of thoery for quicker calculations and a more widely applicable range of molecule sizes and basis sets.},

  higher local minima, resulting in higher energy distorted molecular geometries. These problems mostly arise from untrained experimatlists not understanding the importance of basis set selection, but are also compounded by the difficulty in accessing the specific parameters related to the SCF calculation. This later issue makes it especially problematic when comparing results from multiple software packages, where the same inputs can lead to varied results depending on which code is used.},
